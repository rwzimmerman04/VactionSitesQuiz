Angel Falls is a waterfall in Venezuela. It is the world's tallest uninterrupted waterfall, with a height of 3,212 ft, and a plunge of 2,648 ft. The waterfall drops over the edge of the Auyán-tepui mountain in the Canaima National Park. The waterfall has been known as Angel Falls since the mid-20th century; they are named after Jimmie Angel, a U.S. aviator, who was the first person to fly over the falls. Angel's ashes were scattered over the falls on 2 July 1960. During his expedition to find the fabled city of El Dorado, Walter Raleigh described what was possibly a tepui (table top mountain), and he is said to have been the first European to view Angel Falls, although these claims are considered far-fetched. Some historians say that the first European to visit the waterfall was Fernando de Berrío, a Spanish explorer and governor from the 16th and 17th centuries.
