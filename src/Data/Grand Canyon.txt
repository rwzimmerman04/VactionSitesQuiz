The Grand Canyon is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States. Nearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. For thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans, who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it. The Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin, which has developed over the past 70 million years.
